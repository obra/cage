## Project Notes

Added tmux window information to packnplay list command. The enhancement shows which tmux windows containers are running in, making it easier for users to reattach to the correct session.

Implementation location: /Users/jesse/Documents/GitHub/packnplay/cmd/list.go

New helper function getTmuxWindows() queries tmux and returns a map of worktree names to window display names.

Note: Window name matching uses exact worktree names. If worktree names contain special characters that get sanitized by tmux (: . / space), the matching may not work perfectly. This is documented in code comments and could be enhanced later if needed.
