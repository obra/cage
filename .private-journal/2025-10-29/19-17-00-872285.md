## Project Notes

packnplay + Cursor CLI integration research complete:

Key decision points:
1. Docker layer position: UPPER (frequent updates every 2-4 weeks)
2. Installation method: curl script OR manual binary placement from downloads.cursor.com
3. Environment variables needed: CURSOR_API_KEY (required)
4. Configuration: ~/.cursor/cli-config.json (permissions only at project level)
5. Verification: cursor-agent --version
6. PATH setup: Add ~/.local/bin to PATH

Warnings to document:
- Beta software with known breaking changes
- Expensive for heavy automation use ($200+/month realistic for professional use)
- Docker container issues reported (indexing, authentication)
- No unlimited "Auto" mode like in IDE
- Proprietary license

Similar pattern to other AI CLIs but with unique challenges around pricing model and beta stability.
